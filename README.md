# Project 1: Calculating probability distribution functions for ions in Jupiter's magnetosphere
* Formatting, processing and read in magnetic field and ion data and set physical parameters
* Data interpolation and linearization, calculating relative extrema
* Develope step detection algorithm that automatically finds strongest increase/decrease in data set
* Sort data sets according to relative position of detected steps
* Calculate distribution functions for different ion species based on earlier calculations
* Error analysis in Poisson statistics
* Data visualization and interpretation and implications for dynamics and processes in Jupiter's magnetosphere
