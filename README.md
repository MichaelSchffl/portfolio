# Project 1: Calculating probability distribution functions for ions in Jupiter's magnetosphere
## short description:
Jupiter's magnetosphere contains many energetic ions [100keV -10 MeV]. It has been a puzzling enigma what physical mechanism drives the acceleration of these ions in certain regions of Jupiter's magnetosphere. In this extensive research project I wanted to look deeper into that problem by calculating distributions of energy and pitch angle of these ions, where the pitch angle is the angle between a magnetic field line and the ion. From the this analysis I was able to infer on the underlying physical mechanism and make a guess for the cause of the ion acceleration.

## technical implementations:
* Formatting, processing and read in magnetic field and ion data and set physical parameters
* Data interpolation and linearization, calculating relative extrema
* Develope step detection algorithm that automatically finds strongest increase/decrease in data set
* Sort data sets according to relative position of detected steps
* Calculate distribution functions for different ion species based on earlier calculations
* Error analysis in Poisson statistics
* Data visualization and interpretation and implications for dynamics and processes in Jupiter's magnetosphere
